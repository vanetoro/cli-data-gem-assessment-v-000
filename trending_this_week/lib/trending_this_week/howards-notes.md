Hi Vanessa!

Here are some follow up notes regarding your project.  This file is an index, and
notes are listed by file name and line number.  Have a look through them and see
if the suggestions make sense to you.  

CLI lines 2 & 57
Spots starting on line 4

A general note -- I should have noticed this yesterday, but the entire project really should be in its own repository on GH rather than being nested inside the lesson that describes the project guidelines.  See if you can figure out how to move it into its own repo.

Finally, to be super picky ;)  -- watch your indentation and make sure that you're consistently indenting two spaces inside each method, block, etc...

As always, let me know if you have any questions!

Howard
